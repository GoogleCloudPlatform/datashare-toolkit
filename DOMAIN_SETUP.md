[Back to DS](./README.md)

# Overview
Datashare requires two domains, one for the UI, and one for the API layer. We recommend configuring as such:
- https://datashare.your_domain.com/
- https://api.datashare.your_domain.com/

# Pre-requisites
You must have access to configure DNS for the domains that you will use.

# Configuring your domains using the GCP Cloud DNS console

# Configuring your domains using the gcloud CLI
