[Back to Datashare](./README.md)

# Overview
In order to simplify test drive use-cases of Datashare, this release incorporates the ability to have one UI and API integrate with multiple GCP projects.

# Outstanding
This functionality so far is mainly to be used for non-marketplace integrated use-cases as the procurement Pub/Sub connection has yet to be migrated to have multi-tenant support. This will be completed in the short future.
