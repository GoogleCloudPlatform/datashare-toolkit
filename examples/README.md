# Examples

The below examples are provided to illustrate ingesting and entitling data with `DS`. Please note that the scenarios create and delete a new storage bucket within the span of an example execution. In typical operations, buckets would persist across an indefinite number of ingestion cycles, and the ingestion function would be re-deployed as needed.

## Scenarios

* [Weather observations](weather/README.md)
* [Major League Baseball game statistics](mlb/README.md)
