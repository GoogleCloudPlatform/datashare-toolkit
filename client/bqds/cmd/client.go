	Use:   "client",
	Short: "BQDS client service",
	Long: `The BQDS client service is a daemon that will listen to various POSIX server interfaces
to stream messages to GCP. For example:

Input (stdin/file): '{"a": 123}\n{"b": "xyz"}'
Socket (unix/tcp): '/tmp/echo.sock'
Websocket: 'wss://127.0.0.1:8000'
Multicast: '224.0.1.0:264'
`,

		fmt.Println("client called. add main logic here")
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(clientCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// clientCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// clientCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
