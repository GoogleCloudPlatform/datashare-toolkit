In order to integrate Datashare with Google Cloud Marketplace, you must first sign up to become a [Google Cloud Marketplace vendor](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners). Once you have been approved as a partner you may then list your data solutions within Marketplace. The on-boarding team will provide you with access to the Producer Portal or the Partner Portal which you will use to create your marketplace solutions. Depending on which they provide you access to follow the link to the respective instructions below:
