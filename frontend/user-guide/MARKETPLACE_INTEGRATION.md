## <a name="becoming_a_marketplace_vendor">Becoming a Marketplace vendor</a>
In order to integrate Datashare with Google Cloud Marketplace, you must first sign up to become a [Google Cloud Marketplace vendor](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners). Once you have been approved as a partner you may then list your data solutions within Marketplace. The on-boarding team will provide you with access to the [Producer Portal](https://console.cloud.google.com/producer-portal) or the [Partner Portal](https://console.cloud.google.com/producer-portal) which you will use to create your marketplace solutions. The Producer Portal is the new marketplace solution management console, while the Partner Portal is the older console. Eventually, all solutions will migrate to the Producer Portal. Depending on which they provide you access to follow the link to the respective instructions below:

- [Producer Portal Integration](./PRODUCER_PORTAL.md)
- [Partner Portal Integration](./PARTNER_PORTAL.md)

## Testing your published products
After your products are published on Google Cloud Marketplace, you can test them without being charged for your usage of the products. [Testing your published Google Cloud Marketplace products](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/testing-products) describes how to set up your products for testing.
