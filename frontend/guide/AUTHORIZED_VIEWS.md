## <a name="viewing_authorized_views">Viewing Authorized Views</a>
The authorized views UI shows a listing of all of the authorized views managed by Datashare. An authorized view is considered managed by Datashare when it is created through the 'Create Authorized View' functionality of Datashare, and is labled with key 'datashare_managed' and value of 'true'. If you want to view the authorized views that are managed and created by Datashare, click the button with the ellipsis image in the rightmost column and click 'Views'.

## <a name="creating_a_view">Creating a View</a>
1. Click the 'CREATE AUTHORIZED VIEW' button on the top right.
2. Provide a view name and description.
3. Select the dataset Id for where you want to create the new authorized view. It is recommended that this be created in a dataset that's used primarly for sharing data.
4. Choose if you want to configure the view using 'Source-based' or 'Custom'.
    * Source-based: provides a wizard like setup requiring little to no writing of SQL.
    * Custom: provides ability to write SQL directly.

### Row Level Access
Row level access configuration works in conjunction with policies. Row level access tags that accounts are entitled to are configured within [policies](./POLICIES.md/#creating_a_policy), and in this section is where you can define a single column to use for performing the row level filtering. The column may also contain a delimited list of values to use. In this example we're using a column named 'label' and there are multiple values in the column delimited by a pipe '|'.

### <a name="public_access">Public Access</a>
If you use a Source-based configuration for an authorized view, you will also have the option to configure 'Public Access'. Public access is a feature that can be enabled and is useful when you're using row-level access. If a user is granted access to a particular dataset or view, however doesn't have access to any rows, then the public access will kick in and provide the user with public access (sample data).

### Expiration
In the event where you want a consumer to have limited access to an authorized view, you may define an expiration date and time. You may also choose to delete the view upon expiry, if you do not want to delete the view upon expiry, then the view will continue to exist, though the consumer will have zero rows returned, or the [public access](#public_access) data returned (if configured).
